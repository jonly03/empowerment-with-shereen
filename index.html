                    feel
                    like
                    I am a patient getting ready to lie down on a couch and have my heart written out. With Shereen's
                    guidance, I was able to accept who I am and learn to love myself. She is a great listener,
                    empathetic,
                    and I have no idea where she gets her energy from. That smile though!! Her advice always helps me
                    self-reflect to know what to do, instead of get told what to do. It's as if she knows I will be on
                    my
                    own one day, and she's helping me get ready. She is trustworthy, ethical, and somehow, her voice
                    always resonates with me when I am alone. I never felt uncomfortable approaching her with any
                    problem.
                    Amazing is an understatement; Shereen is the best!

                    energetic,
                    fun, and absolutely brilliant. She has been such an inspiration to me through her incredible
                    capacity
                    for creative thinking mixed with compassion and the ability to make people feel comfortable, but
                    also
